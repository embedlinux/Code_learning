# Purpose:
#
#   This file contains options that configure aspects of the execution
#   testbench.  You can edit this file to change these options.
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Testbench options. Set an option to yes to enable, no to disable.
DSM            := no    # Set to 'yes' to use the carbon model with register visibility and tarmac
                        # TARMAC config is ignored unless DSM is set to 'yes'
TARMAC         := yes   # Enable tarmac trace of code as it is executed
SIM_64BIT      := yes   # Use 64-bit simulation
SIM_VCD        := no    # Turn off VCD output
GUI            := no    # Non interactive simulation
FSDB           := no    # Disable FSDB output

MAX_SIMULATION_TIME := 40000us # Default maximum simulation time

# Compilation options
TOOL_CHAIN     := gcc  # Default C compiler is gcc

# Simulator
SIMULATOR      := mti  # Default simulator is Mentor ModelSim

# PlusArgs
#PLUSARGS        +=

# Source code paths
TESTCODES_PATH    = ../testcodes

# Important notes:
# ================
#
#  1. If you change any of the testbench options in this file you must run
#     'make clean' on the top-level Makefile and then recompile the testbench.
#
#  2. 64-bit simulation is only possible on 64-bit operating systems
