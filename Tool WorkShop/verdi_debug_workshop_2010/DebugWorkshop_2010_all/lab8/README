Design in the example:
----------------------
This is a systemverilog design with assertion.

The directory contains:
----------------------
o *.sv              - The directory which contains the source RTL files.
o SETUP            - The file to set up NOVAS and Synopsys environments.
o COMPILE          - Script to use vericom to compile SystemVerilog design.
o RUN*             - Script to run Verdi for demonstration.
o SIM*             - Script to dump FSDB with VCS.
o CLEAN            - Script to clean the old log files,libraries and simulation executable file.

How to run the example:
----------------------
o Dump FSDB files 
  *NOTE : Remember to modify SETUP file according to your environments.
  %> ./SIM_RTL     - Dump SystemVerilog signals to rtl.fsdb
  %> ./SIM_SVA     - Dump SystemVerilog signals include SVA assertions to sv.fsdb

o Run Verdi Demonstration
  %> ./RUN         - Verdi import SystemVerilog design with sv.fsdb loaded.
