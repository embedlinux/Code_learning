o *.v              - The directory which contains the source RTL files.
o SETUP            - The file to set up NOVAS, Cadence and Synopsys environments.
o COMPILE          - Script to use vericom to compile pure Verilog design.
o RUN*             - Script to run Verdi for demonstration.
o run_ncsim*       - Script to dump FSDB with IUS or VCS.
o CLEAN            - Script to clean the old log files and work library

How to run the example:
----------------------
o Dump FSDB files 
  *NOTE : Remember to modify SETUP file according to your environments.
  %> ./SIM.rtl     - Dump pure Verilog signals to rtl.fsdb

o Run Verdi Demonstration
  %> ./RUN         - Verdi import pure verilog design with rtl.fsdb loaded.
