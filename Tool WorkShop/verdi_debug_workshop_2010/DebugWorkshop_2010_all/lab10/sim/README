Running Simulations
-------------------

NOTE: To run within the Verilab environment, prefix all 
commands with ./run_vlab

NOTE: To run the commands within Novas, uncomment the 
appropriate environment variables in the run_sv and 
run_verdi_sv scripts (untested).

To run the SystemVerilog version of the test environment:

    run_sv [--test file] [--seed value]
    run_verdi_sv (to load Verdi)

Use --test to run a different test: The default test program is
'../sv/test_random.sv'; the only other test currently existing is
'../sv/test_direct.sv'.

Use --seed to pass a specific random seed value into vcs via
'+ntb_random_seed=value'.

Coverage
--------

To view the SystemVerilog coverage using URG:

    urg -dir simv.vdb

Then, point your browser to:

    <cwd>/urgReport/dashboard.html

NOTE: Each time a test is run a new coverage database is dumped
(even if you've rerun with the same seed). URG merges the results
from all previous runs when generating a report.

Running the e Testbench
-----------------------

To run the e version of this environment:

    run_vcs
    run_verdi
