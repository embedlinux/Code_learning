1. The demo package is composed of the following files:
   
   README               This file
   SETUP                Sets the tool paths. This file is not needed if you already
                        have your simulation and siloti environments set up. However,
                        if you don't modify the paths in the SETUP file and you do use
                        any of the RUN.* or SIM.* files, you'll want to remove the
                        source ./SETUP statements from these files.
   CLEAN                Remove extraneous log files.
   fullchip.list        ESD hierarchical list generated with scope tb_CPUsytem and using
                        symbol library first.
   fullchip.list.plst   ESD plain list corresponding to above.
                        NOTE: The simulation uses the plain list format for consistency
                        between simulators. You can change the format used by modifying
                        the file name input for fsdbDumpvarsToFile in the 
                        src/tb_CPUsystem.v file.
   src                  Directory containing design files.
   *.fsdb               Sample FSDB files.
   run.f                Original run file.
   RUN.siloti           Script to run siloti and load essential signal FSDB.
   RUN.esa              Script to run essential signal analysis from the command line.
   SIM.vcs              Sample script to run VCS simulation.
   SIM.ncv              Sample script to run NCV simulation.
   pcu_observable*      Sample hierarchical and plain format essential signal lists to
                        show different DE coverage. Not used.

2. To re-generate the essential signal FSDB file, do the following:
  
   a. Generate the fullchip.* essential signal list files using the RUN.esa script.
   b. Simulate using the SIM.* script or create a simulation script for your preferred
      simulator.
