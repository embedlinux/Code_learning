<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "asy_64_1.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of dcfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "asy_64_1.v".  The design "asy_64_1.v" has a depth of 64 words of 1 bits each. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
