@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"g:\gowin_test\dbstar_rgmii\par\fpga_project_1\src\top.v":36:0:36:5|Found inferred clock top|clk which controls 60 sequential elements including cnt0[0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
