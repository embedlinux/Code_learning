Directory for running simulations on the SVA implementation of OVL.

To compare reports across the 3 main simulators:

  cd ~/other/OVL/ovl_regressions/dynamic_simulation/assert_sva05

  tkdiff mti/report/tb_assert_simulation-MTI_SVA.rpt vcs/report/tb_assert_simulation-VCS_SVA.rpt

There are currently problems with NC and the SVA implementation of OVL, so the comparisons below are not currently possible.

  tkdiff mti/report/tb_assert_simulation-MTI_SVA.rpt  nc/report/tb_assert_simulation-NC_SVA.rpt
  tkdiff  nc/report/tb_assert_simulation-NC_SVA.rpt  vcs/report/tb_assert_simulation-VCS_SVA.rpt
